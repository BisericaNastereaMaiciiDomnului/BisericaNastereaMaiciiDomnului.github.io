            <br>
            <p>The Parish of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in the North of England is under the jurisdiction of the Romanian Orthodox Metropolis of Western and Southern Europe and was established in December 2024, with the blessing of His Holiness Metropolitan Joseph. The fundamental purpose of the Parish is to provide all the people of Carlisle and other localities in the North West of England with the necessary means for the practice of the Orthodox faith.
                <br><br>Our Christian community aims to carry out religious, cultural, educational and philanthropic activities, which do not contradict the legal provisions of England, Romania and the Tradition of the Orthodox Church. These activities are possible thanks to the involvement of all volunteers, of the benevolent people of the community, who help us according to their own abilities.
                <br><br>From December 2024 - we are renting the Blessed Christopher Robinson House Chapel, Lismore Place Carlisle CA1 1LZ, on a permanent basis, for Sunday Holy Mass, from 10 am, in Romanian / English.
                <br><br>We also organize religious services during the week. For Religious Services such as baptisms, weddings, memorial services for the deceased, prayers for mothers after childbirth, house blessings and others, please contact the parish priest, Andrei Brisca, by phone. Phone: 07488295268.
                <br><br>All funds of our parish and charitable community come exclusively from voluntary donations. May the good Lord bless you and reward all your sacrifice! We remember you in prayer and invite you to be with us with your thoughts and with all your being. The financial activity of the parish charitable organization is under the control of HMRC (the UK tax service). I remind you all that all donations, and the funds collected from the sales at the pangar will be used for the proper functioning of our church.
